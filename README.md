NetbeansTheme
=============

Netbeans theme based on Aloha by Mike McKinney (huikau.com) heavily edited - grab either the mac or pc version to try it out (the mac version uses Monaco vs Consolas in the theme for pc).

The original theme was put together for the following languages: Ruby, XML, C, Java, JavaScript and CSS. I've optimised my colour schemes primarily for Ruby, PHP, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
